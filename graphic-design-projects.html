      <h1>Graphic Design Projects</h1>
      <p>
        Here are all of the graphic design projects I've made over the course of
        my time at Verrado High School! These projects range from logos, to
        flyers, to brochures, to 3D renders. Some of them were made for
        SkillsUSA competitions and one was made for a real company that they use
        today!
