        Hey, I'm Leo! I'm a high school student looking for an opportunity to
        gain experience in the field of graphic design, web development, or any
        other related subjects. At my high school I learn graphic design and at
        West-MEC I learn coding/web development. I have experience working with
        a client to develop work for them and am ready to use my technical
        skills in a professional setting. I have multiple
        <span><a href="award-projects.html">awards</a></span> from the CTSO
        competitions I competed in my junior year of high school. By the end of
        my junior year I will have an Adobe illustrator certification and an ITS
        certification in HTML5 Application Development. I have hobbies in
        gaming, collecting figurines and other collectibles, and game
        development!
