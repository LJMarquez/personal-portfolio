      <h1>Award Winning Projects</h1>
      <p>
        Here are all of the projects that have won me awards at all of the CTSO
        competitions I have competed in! I started going to these competitions
        in 2024 and I partook in the Advertising Design competition for
        SkillsUSA and the Website Coding and Development competition for FBLA
        (Future Business Leaders of America). For SkillsUSA I placed first for the regional competition, first for the state competition, and will be going to the national competition in Atlanta Georgia this summer! For FBLA I placed first in the regional competition, third for the state competition, qualified to go to the national competition but unfortunately won't be attending it due to scheduling conflicts. Below you'll find the work I produced for these competitions!
